* [ ] Each sprint event has a maximum duration
* [ ] A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
* [ ] Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.
* [ ] During the Sprint no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* [ ] During the Sprint quality goals do not decrease

* [ ] SM ensures that the event takes place and that atendants understand its purpose.
* [ ] Sprint planning purposes
  * What can be done this Sprint?
    * The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.
    * The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.
    * During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also creates a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.
  * How will the chosen work get done?
    * The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.
* [ ] Sprint goal is created during Sprint planning 
* [x] Daily Scrum is 15-minute time boxed event for the DT
* [x] Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint
* [x] During Daily Scrum the DT plans work for next 24 hours
* [x] Daily Scrum is held at the same time each day
* [x] Daily Scrum is held at the same place each day
* [x] Daily Scrum example questions:
  * What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal
  * What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
  * Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Teamfrom meeting the Sprint Goal?
* [x] DT members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions
* [ ] SM ensures that the DT has the meeting, but the DT is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum.
* [ ] The SM teaches the DT to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.
* [ ] SM ensures that people from outside DT don't disrupt the meeting
* [ ] Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
* [ ] During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.
* [ ] Sprint Review is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.
* [ ] Sprint Review is no longer than 4 hours for one-month sprint
* [ ] SM ensures that the DT has the Sprint Review,
* [ ] The SM teaches all to keep Sprint Review within the time-box.
* [ ] Sprint Review 
  * attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
  * The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”
  * The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what   problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved
  * The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment
  * The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed)
  * The DT discusses 
    * what went well during the Sprint, 
    * what problems it ran into, 
    * and how those problems were solved
  * The DT demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
  * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning
  * Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next
  * Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.
* [ ] The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.
* [ ] The Sprint Retrospective occurs a$er the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. 
* [ ] The Sprint retrospective is a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. 
* [ ] The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. 
* [ ] The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time-box.
* [ ] The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.
* [ ] The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
  * Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
  * Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; * Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
* Scrum artifacts
  * [ ] Product Backlog
  * [ ] Sprint Backlog
  * [ ] Increment
